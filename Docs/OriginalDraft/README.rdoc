RegAggitate (old name) RegAggregate
 
A region focused news aggregator application

Write in: Ruby, Crystal, CSS

Example:

ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¦ Ukraine Mode (what inspired this project: a lack of a centralized/decentralized easy-access network on news regarding Ukraine)
Will only aggregate news from/about Ukraine, based on preferences. Additionally, sites can be omitted from the list.

This project is merely a portal. There are no trackers, advertisements, or popups until you click on one. Notifications are optional.

This project is designed to promote and spread the coverage of local news. Regional news is also allowed, but can be omitted.
